##### Want to make CGFX packs for GBE+ but don't want to go through the hassle of dumping the tiles and editing the manifest file yourself? Well you've come to the right place! All you need to do is simply edit the graphics then away you go. You can play your games with your own custom graphics in a matter of minutes just by editing the provided images. It's as simple as that!

#### How to use these templates

Download the zip file by pressing the big green button and extract it into your GBE-Plus folder. Edit graphics in the game folder of your choice, load the manifest in the program and play!

If updating to a newer manifest file extract the zip into a NEW folder then copy and paste the text file and overwrite the old one. Be sure to backup your orignial folder before extracting just in case!
